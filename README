This application takes the 2010 Census Tract data from Esri located here: http://server.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/Demographics

Overlays the data on different maps

This API requires several development tools which can be found on this page:
http://help.arcgis.com/en/webapi/silverlight/help/index.html#/System_requirements/01660000000t000000/

This uses the entire US data set avaialbe from Esri.
The initial map extent can easily be changed.
